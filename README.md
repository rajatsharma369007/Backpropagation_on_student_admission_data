# Student Admission Prediction from scratch (with activation layer)

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implementated a training function from scratch using numpy for the prediction of student admission. This one is with activation layer.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Student_Admission_Prediction_with_activation_layer/blob/master/data.csv)  
The first columns is the label (0 implies fail, 1 implies admitted) and 3 input features (gre, gpa, rank).

## Installation
* pandas  
<code>conda install pandas</code>
* numpy  
<code>conda install numpy</code>

## Accuracy
Test score = 0.725

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
